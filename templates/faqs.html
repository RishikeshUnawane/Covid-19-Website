                    <p> Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
                        in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
                        to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                        severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
                        and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
                        discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>

                   <div class="ans">
                     <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                        dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                        congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                        usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                        don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
                        80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
                        Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
                        ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
                        underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems
                        or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with

                    How does COVID-19 spread?

                   <div class="ans">
                     <p> People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                        disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                        the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                        coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
                        the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
                        objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
                        can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
                        with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
                        important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person
                        who is sick.</p>

                    Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
                   </a>
                   <div class="ans">
                     <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
                        transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
                        through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
                        spread?”</p>

                    Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
                   </a>
                   <div class="ans">
                     <p>  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
                        expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
                        from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
                        people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                        particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
                        possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
                        a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>

                    Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?
                   </a>
                   <div class="ans">
                     <p>   The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
                        appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
                        be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a
                        main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
                        COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
                        this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
                        after using the bathroom and before eating.</p>

                    What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease

                     <p>Protection measures for everyone <br>
                        Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                        available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
                        countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
                        have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
                        have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
                        situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. <br>
                        You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions: <br>
                        • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol- based
                        hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing
                        your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand
                        rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. <br>
                        • Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                        anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why?
                        When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                        droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                        are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                        COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. <br>
                        • Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why?
                        Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
                        contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose
                        or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can
                        make you sick. <br>
                        • Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                        respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                        with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
                        dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why?
                        Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you
                        protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and
                        COVID-19. <br>
                        • Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                        difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                        Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why?
                        National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                        information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                        allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                        health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
                        of viruses and other infections. <br>
                        • Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
                        areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                        traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or
                        have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?
                        You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these
                        areas.</p>

                    everyone) <br>
                    o Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even
                    with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C
                    or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential
                    for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g.
                    to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
                    Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities
                    will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help
                    protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other
                    viruses. <br>
                    o If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
                    medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory
                    infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your
                    provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers. Why?
                    Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly
                    direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent

                    The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                    there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. <br>
                    For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
                    still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
                    areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
                    these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
                    and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
                    case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                    restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
                    disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
                    COVID-19. <br>
                    COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
                    has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
                    new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
                    situation where you are or intend to go.</p>

                    Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
            children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about
            1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite
            normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will

            movement and gatherings.</p>

                    Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment
                    of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician

                  <p>  While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide

                  <p>   Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
                    coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
                    Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
                    looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
                    a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
                    wisely. <br>
                    We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
                    wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
                    effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
                    frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
                    or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
                    people who are coughing or sneezing.

                    How to put on use take off and dispose of a mask?

                <div class="ans">
                  <p> 1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers,
                    and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough. <br>
                    2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based
                    hand rub or soap and water. <br>
                    3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes. <br>
                    4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is). <br>
                    5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the
                    coloured side). <br>
                    6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of
                    the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose. <br>
                    7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
                    chin. <br>
                    8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind
                    the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and
                    clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the
                    mask. <br>
                    9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use. <br>
                    10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask
                    – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your
                    hands with soap and water.   </p>

                  <p>   Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
                    animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which
                    may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
                    associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary
                    camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been
                    confirmed. <br>
                    To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid
                    direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure
                    good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal
                    organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid
                    consuming raw or undercooked animal products.

                    transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
                    produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
                    protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. <br>

                  <p>   It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
                    surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
                    suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
                    COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
                    several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
                    surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). <br>
                    If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
                    to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with
                    an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
                    touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.
